# datatypes

Package datatypes provides a set of useful data types that can deal with different types of data, such as data that contain an error, data that doesn't exist, data that doesn't exist _yet_, data that keeps changing, and etc.

This is a functional programming library. The practical part of FP is all about higher level abstractions such as these and combining their behaviors to gain properties and functionality to deal with data in even more complex situations.
